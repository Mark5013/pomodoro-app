<h1>PomoTracker</h1>

<div> 
  <p>PomoTracker is a productivity web app that is based on the Pomdoro Method. Following this method
    you work on a task for 25 minutes and then take a short break for 5 minutes. After 4 of these 25 minute
    sessions, you get a long 15 minute break, and the cycle continues. This app provides a timer with default lengths 
    of 25, 5, and 15 minutes and will follow the rules of the Pomodoro method. The timer will be displayed on screen and in
    the title of the page. It will also play a sound once the timer ends. Users can also add/delete/edit/drag tasks around in their
    task list and are allowed to have at most 10 tasks at once. If you decided to login with your google account, the app will track
    your time spent in the focus mode and you can view your stats daily/weekly/monthly/yearly. You will also be able to configure the timer 
    lengths in the settings page. More settings will most likely be coming soon like being able to change the sound of the timer and other things
    of that nature.
